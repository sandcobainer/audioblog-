  desc: Performed crash predicition using MongoDB and Logistic Regression. I setup the geospatial database in MonogDB by combining huge SQL datasets from highway police reports, weather to predict severe crash conditions. A visualization of the research is presented as the data is private only to the research group, Knowledge Discovery in Databases at K-state.

- name: B-Link , Hack K-State 2016
  #i18n: morrowind-translation
  gh_user: sandcobainer
  repo: B-Link
  url: https://github.com/sandcobainer/B-Link
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/blink.png
  desc: B-Link is a pacman game I desgined with my friend 'dissid' for Hack K-State 2016. The game runs through pygame and used Opencv to detect eye blinks of the gamer. The eye blink triggers a world update within the game, the number of blinks depends on the levels progressed through the game. When the player is cornered, the player can 'blink' to a new world of relatively better positions.

  desc: webSamplr is a Max4Live device that enables the user to sample any sound source from the internet. It includes track and clip navigation within Ableton Live, as well as a database of popular sampling websites and sources. This sampler was updated to detect sample rate, show waveform in a spectograph and navigate only to copyright free websites.

  desc: This is a Max4Live MIDI script written using Ableton Live's Max live.api objects to navigate and control almost anything  on the Ableton Live screen. The script was setup for a basic 25$ MIDI keyboard using 2 channels of MIDI stream data. The script efficiently uses all 48 buttons on the board and was setup intuitively for live music looping.
