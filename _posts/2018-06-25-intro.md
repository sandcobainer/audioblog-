This series of blogs document my research and projects taken up during my independent study in ART 890 in Fall 2018. What started as a need for USB controllers to produce and mix a track on a DAW turned my interest towards touch free musical instruments. I came across this *ghostly device* called a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin "Wikipedia: Theremin").

# **The Build?**
While building such an analog instrument is beyond my research of gestural musical devices (*I'm not good at analog electronics*), the idea is fascinating. I got prototyping with an Arduino and came up with multiple designs. Choosing the right sensor to approximate distance of the hand is a tricky problem. Sensor vary between reliability and range. 

## Choosing sensors
Quick summary of the sensors I used to calculate distances or light levels:

1. [Ultrasonic Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13959): Reliable and easy to use but fail at defining edges of the hands
2. [Infrared distance sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/164?gclid=CjwKCAiAl7PgBRBWEiwAzFhmmjPzgxa25XUHEoyhhUs8gs9ze6MXPfCK2L1hJPB11AbE9sibl4VSTxoCAwYQAvD_BwE): Reliable but fails in low light conditions
3. [Photo Cell](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161): Very abstract and unreliable as they change with light conditions

All these sensors have a common limitation of accuracy and range. They either work in a narrow band of 5-10 cms wide or are sensitive to light conditions. Irregular pitch and volume changes makes this instrument unplayable unless you want to create irregular sound patterns and spikes. 

Might be an instrument for the **[noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGrN6PeIiOU)** genre of music. This initial prototype sets up the requirements for a robust playable instrument
1. large playable surface
2. reliable distance calculation
3. low light condition playability

## **Leap Motion**
After a few hours of research and browsing similar projects, I settled with a sensor that is being widely used in gaming, VR and the latest IPhone X's [True Depth IR camera](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108), the ***Leap Motion***. [How does the Leap Motion work?](http://blog.leapmotion.com/hardware-to-software-how-does-the-leap-motion-controller-work/)

[Leap Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_Motion), Inc. is an American company that manufactures and markets a computer hardware sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as input, analogous to a mouse, but requires no hand contact or touching. The next blog will dive into setting up and work with Leap Motion to calculate hand distances.

Check out the github repo for the Arduino controlled theremin, [ardutheremi](https://github.com/sandcobainer/ardutheremi).
