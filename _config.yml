  desc: Data science/machine learning engineer, embedded systems, audio programmer and musician. 
  detail: Constantly experimenting innovative solutions to engineer databases/datasets and apply machine learning in media art, medical science, home automation, embedded wearables or any similar interfacable technologies. I like using machine learning and statistics to solve problems for art of medical sciences. Hacking new micro-controllers or sensors on a daily basis is a goal I am trying to fulfill through a professional job.  
  subtit: Hack anything, build something.  # Describe yourself.
